Ah, this is an exciting moment! Before we hit cargo run, let me walk you through what to expect and how to interpret what happens:
When you run the program, a few things will happen in sequence:

First, the program will initialize its logging system. You should see some startup messages in your terminal showing the logging configuration.
Then it will attempt to load the font files and glyphs. This is a potential point where you might see errors if:

The font file "NotoSansMayanNumerals-Regular.ttf" isn't in the expected assets/fonts/ directory
The glyph image files aren't in the correct paths as specified in config.rs


Next, it will create the main window using eframe. You should see a window appear with:

A clock display at the top
The Long Count calendar display
Tzolk'in and Haab' dates with their corresponding glyphs (if loaded)
Astronomical information panel
Historical events (if any correspond to today's date)



If you encounter any errors, don't worry! That's completely normal when running a complex program for the first time. Let me know what happens and I can help interpret any error messages or unexpected behavior we see.
Would you like to try running it now? Remember to have your terminal in the project directory when you run cargo run!
