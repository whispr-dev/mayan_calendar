Ah, I see your point, mon ami! 700 lines is quite a lot, and it can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Let's put on our optimization hats and see how we can streamline this Mayan calendar app! ðŸŽ©ðŸ’»
Here are a few ideas for optimizing the code:

Extract date conversion functions: The gregorian_to_jdn, tzolkin_date, and haab_date functions are used in multiple places. We could move these into a separate date_utils module to keep the main file more focused.
Simplify glyph loading: The load_tzolkin_image_as_texture and load_haab_image_as_texture functions are nearly identical. We could create a single load_glyph_texture function that takes the glyph type as a parameter.
Use a config file for glyph paths: Instead of hardcoding the glyph file paths in the get_tzolkin_glyphs and get_haab_glyphs functions, we could read them from a configuration file. This would make it easier to change the paths if needed.
Refactor the ui_example function: This function is quite long and does a lot of different things. We could break it up into smaller functions for rendering different parts of the UI, like render_long_count, render_calendar_rounds, render_astronomical_info, etc.
Use a struct for solstice/equinox events: Instead of using tuples for the solstice and equinox events, we could define a struct with named fields. This would make the code more readable.
Precompute common values: Some values, like the tzolkin and haab names, are used in multiple places. We could compute these once and store them in constants or lazy_static variables.
Use a more efficient algorithm for historical events: The current implementation does a linear search through the events array for each date. We could use a more efficient data structure, like a binary search tree or a hashmap, to speed this up.

These are just some initial ideas, but they should give you a sense of the kinds of optimizations we can make. The key is to look for patterns in the code and think about how we can make it simpler and more efficient.
Let me know if you have any other questions as you work through optimizing the code. I'm here to help in any way I can! Together, we can take this Mayan calendar app to the next level of performance and elegance. ðŸš€âœ¨



Would you like me to continue with organizing the rest of the code? I can focus on:

The UI rendering components
The glyph handling system
The performance metrics and caching
The calendar calculations

Also, I notice some potential improvements we could make to the error handling and testing infrastructure. Would you like me to address those as well?



Add async/await support for non-blocking operations?
Create a visualization for the performance data?



Would you like me to:

Add more interactive features to the components?
Implement animations for transitions?
Add theming support?
Create more detailed documentation?


Would you like me to:

Add more advanced caching strategies?
Implement glyph animations?
Add support for different glyph sizes?
Create a more detailed error recovery system?




Code Organization:
Consider moving the astronomical calculations into a separate module (like astronomical.rs) to keep the main file more organized.



n your astronomical calculations (astronomical.rs):

The moon phase calculation could be more accurate by considering lunar anomaly
The Venus phase calculation could benefit from incorporating the planet's eccentricity


In the CalendarCache:

Consider adding a method to prune old entries
Could implement a way to prefetch likely-to-be-needed dates


In Config:

The hardcoded paths might be better as environment variables or config file entries
Could add error handling for missing glyph files












fren, if you look at this code, you'll see you said // The rest of the implementations follow... // [Note: I'll continue with more sections, but this gives you an idea of  // how we're reorganizing the code. Would you like me to focus on any  // particular part next] - could you go ahead and actually do that using the two code sections i've provided to somehow make an actual optimized decent fully functional working script please? [i've also included the config.rs and date_utils.rs files so you can see what they do/are for`]


I'll help reorganize and complete the code to create a fully functional Mayan Calendar application. I'll analyze what we have and combine the parts into a cohesive whole.

Let me create another artifact for the calendar constants and core data structures that we'll include:
